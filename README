Hey Guys, so this is where we will be doing our actual coding.  What i think we should be doing to do this is to get the most updated code from this repository, save it to your computer and use it for the source code, then any additions you want to make, make it them in the Github code.

This may be a little repetitive and annoying but it will ensure that we are all using up to date versions of the code.
